# Business Agent

Business Agent provides a dedicated query path, six fixed draft-creation
commands, and a canary signed chat approval path for sales and purchase orders.
It does not change Nostr kinds, Relay behavior, or Business Dock authentication.
Shipment, receipt, payment, reverse, allocate, post and payment-execution
approvals remain unavailable to the Agent.

trusted Buzz event -> active identity binding -> short turn delegation
-> business-read-mcp -> Production Adapter -> Business API final authorization
-> Business Core user permission/scope check -> result -> Buzz answer -> biz:// link
```

This repository still has no customer ERP credentials or authoritative
production endpoint. It now includes an independently runnable reference
Business Read API backed by a versioned, explicitly desensitized acceptance
snapshot for anomaly acceptance. The live draft path exercises service authentication, final delegation checks,
formal multi-dimensional scope intersection, V4 reads, V5 rules, Trace and
`biz://` links, while Business Core remains authoritative for every write.
